<h1>Rolling a Tesselation Polyhedron in its Tiling Net</h1>
<p>This work is focused around <strong>regular-faced
polyhedrons for which some nets are mosaics or tiling patterns</strong>.</p>
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">net of a
polyhedron</span> is the adjancement of its faces on a plane in a
way that folding the net would reconstruct the polyhedron.</p>
<h1><img src="images/net_demo.png" alt=""><br>
</h1>
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">tesselation
net</span> is a net that can be used to tile (<span style="font-style: italic;">tesselate</span>) the
plane.<br>
<img src="images/tile_images/tesselation.png" alt=""><br>
We will now consider convex polyhedron which only have regular faces.
Those are the five Platonic solids wich are completely regluar, the 13
Archimedean solids, prisms and antiprisms, and 92 Johnson solids.<br>
From those, it was shown that 23 have tesselation nets.<br>
<img src="images/white/all.gif" alt=""><br>
Those tesselations can be seen as an infinite grid of shapes filling
the space. My goal is to see how the polyhedron building the tiling can
roll in it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rolling</span>
means that the polyhedron starts somewhere on its net, with its
corresponding face down. It then "rolls" to an adjacent polygon.<br>
Not all tesselation polyhedron roll in the same patterns.<br>
<br>
There are mainly<span style="font-weight: bold;"> three
types of patterns</span>:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shapes that can roll in the full space</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/tile_images/ex1.png" alt=""><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shapes that can roll in a "corridor"</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/tile_images/Image4.png" alt=""><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shapes that cannot escape a given area</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
There are many ways to unfold a single polyhedron. By considering the
adjacent faces of a polyhedron as connected nodes, we can see each net
as a specific spanning tree.<br>
<img src="images/capture_028_21042017_211905.png" alt=""><br>
Many such produced nets are identical due to the internal symmetries of
our polyhedrons. There are also symmetrical versions of each net that
can be removed.<br>
<img src="images/capture_027_21042017_211853.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
Those nets can then be tested for tesselation. The process involves
sticking two versions of the net together, forming a bigger shape.<br>
By sticking two shapes together, we can often tell early if it will
become a tesselation net or not: during the stiching, we fuse the edges
of the two shapes together, so if a side has an angle that goes inside
the shape, we know it will not work.<br>
<img src="images/sides.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
A tesselation can be represented very simply. Take this tesselation of
a cube for example:<br>
<img src="images/white/cube_tess.png" alt=""><br>
If you look closely, each net is similarly attached to its neighbours. <br>
This gives us a way to model a tesselation net, by indicating for each
side what face should be adjacent. By simply repeating that pattern we
can reproduce the whole tesselation.<br>
<img src="images/tile_images/capture_016_21042017_193502.png" alt=""> &nbsp; <img src="images/tile_images/capture_007_21042017_193258.png" alt=""><br>
Of course, two problems arise:<br>
When a shape has twice the same neighbour, there is no way to tell from
which way the shapes are supposed to be attached.<br>
When a shape has itself as a neighbour twice, it becomes hard to tell
from which way they are supposed to be attached.<br>
<br>
Hence, instead of simply indicating the neighbour's face number, we add
a multiple of the amount of faces to differenciate directions.<br>
We use:<br>
len : amount of faces<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>face ID : the net's internal ID</li>
<li>attach ID: 0 if it's an internal link or if the face is
attached to itself simply, k&gt;0 if the face is leaving its net,
different k if a face is attached several times to the same face</li>
<li>attach sign: + and - to indicate the order of attach for
shapes attached to themselves doubly</li>
</ul>
<p>So the value used will be:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>tile ID = face ID + len * attach_id * attach sign</li>
</ul>
<p>From this value we can find back the original values by doing</p>
<ul>
<li>face ID = abs(tile ID - (tile ID % len))</li>
<li>attach ID =&nbsp; abs(floor( tile ID / len))</li>
<li>attach sign = sign(tile ID)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
When a face is attached to two faces of the same ID, we can
differenciate them trough the attach ID. See <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">cubeTesselation</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>1, 3 where
different attach have different k. We can ignore the attach ID the rest
of the time.<br>
When a face is attached to itself doubly, we can determine the
direction it is attached to thanks to the opposite signs of the two
links. See <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">pyramidTesselation</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>0 where 0 is
attached to both 0+len and 0-len. We can ignore the sign the rest of
the time.<br>
When a face is attached to itself simply, we ignore the attach ID or
sign. See <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">cubeTesselation</span>
4 and 5.<br>
When a face is attached to another face in the original net, we ignore
attach ID or sign. See <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">cubeTesselation</span>
0.
<p>Examples (the description of the polyhedrons are separate):<br>
<br>
</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>cubeTesselation = {</em><br><em>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5: [<span style="font-weight: bold;">5</span>+0,2-len,1-len,1]</em><br><em>
}</em><br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>pyramidTesselation = {</em><br><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0: [1, <span style="font-weight: bold;">0-len</span>, 3, <span style="font-weight: bold;">0+len</span>],</em><br><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1: [2,0,2+len],</em><br><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2: [1,4+len,1-len],</em><br><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3: [4,0,4+len],</em><br><em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4: [3,2-len,3-len]</em><br><em>
}</em><br></div><p>
<br>
There might be ways to build a tesselation net that doesn't fit this
representation (for examples patterns that would follow a central
symmetry), but I haven't encountered any so far in the tesselation nets.<br>
<br>
Because I couldn't translate the original program's representation into
my own representation, I had to do it by hand. Thus, I only have a few
tesselations nets represented.<br>
<br>
Here are the findings:<br>
Rolling pattern:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Dithered red: visited</li><li>Solid red: visited with exact orientation (translation to the starting point)</li><li>Dithered blue: starting point</li><li>If a starting point is surrounded by solid red, by recursion it can cover the whole space.</li><li>If
a starting point is surrounded by dithered red but there exist solid
red parts, it can cover the whole space by translation to the solid red
parts.</li></ul><table>

1) Rewrite the code provided by my teacher which was used to determine
if a Polyhedron had a tileable net, to produce all tileable nets of one
Tesselation Polyhedron.</p>
<p>At this point of the project, I was unable to completely fullfill
point 1.</p>
<p>2) Determine if the given tiling can be "rolled" into in order
to "roll" on the whole plane, by rolling the Polyhedron into its faces
on its nets.</p><p>At this point of the project, I can visually assess the rolling type.</p>
<p>In order to do 1) I simplified the set of the nets stiching I
was looking for. When testing, all tesselation found so far have been
symmetrical with each tile identical, meaning that they<br>
-Contain translations and rotations, but no reflexion/mirroring<br>
-Can be defined by the description of a single tile's neighbours, which
are then repeated to create the pattern.<br>
If every tesselation possible with the given shapes can be represented
by this model is still an open question. (This model cannot represent
central symmetry, or non-periodic patterns)</p>
<p>A Regular-Faced Polyhedron can be represented as a dictionary
of faces and their adjacent faces:<br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>
J1R = { #order is clockwise<br>
0: [1,2,3,4],<br>
1: [0,4,2],<br>
2: [1,3,0],<br>
3: [0,2,4],<br>
4: [0,3,1]<br>
}</em></div><p></p>
<p>Based on this, I represent a tile's pattern as:<br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>
J1N = { #order is clockwise<br>
0: [1,0-p,3,0+p],<br>
1: [0,2+p,2],<br>
2: [1,4+2*p,1-p],<br>
3: [0,4-p,4],<br>
4: [3+p,3,2-2*p]<br>
}</em></div><p></p>
<p><img src="j1_pyramid_n.png" alt="Representation of a pyramid's tiling pattern"></p>
<p>Internal neighbours are the number of the adjacent face on the
net. External neighbours are differenciated by adding a multiple of p
being the number of sides of the polyhedron to the neighbour's number.
The multiple is used to show which adjacent shape is touching, in case
the same shape is several times a neighbour. <br>
In case a shape is its own neighbour, the inverted sign of this
represent which side is linked.<br>
This information is enough to create the tile pattern as we just have
to match the faces calling eachother by the sides that they call
eachother trough.</p>
<p>By limiting to tile pattern that fit this representation, it
would also simplify the research of tile patterns.<br>
The original code extended a tile pattern randomly by stitching a tile
to a random side and checking for collisions on the touching sides
adjacent to the stitched side.<br>
Each time we extend the pattern on one edge, we can also extend it on
its symmetrical edge (unless the two shapes are touching on the exact
same edge), reducing sensibly the research space.<br>
We also reduce the tiling test requirement at until the starting
shape's sides are entirely covered, as any additional tile would be
symmetrical and redundant.</p><p>[TODO] Unfortunately I haven't been able to make the provided
code output my own format of tesselation representations yet</p>I figured how to remove duplicate nets (by following the angles and comparing them in order and disorder for mirrors).<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>def not_duplicate(oldpaths,path,mirrors=True):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size = len(path)</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for t in oldpaths:</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for start in range(size):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter = 0</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for i in range(1,size): #ignore the first orientation</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(path[i] != t[(start+i)%size]):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter+=1</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(counter==size-1):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return False</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(mirrors==True):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for t in oldpaths:</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for start in range(size):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter = 0</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for i in range(1,size):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(path[i]!=t[(start-i)%size]):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter+=1</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(counter==size-1):</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return False</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #print("Accepted path:",path)</em><br><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return True</em><br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>This
part is in tileset_v2.py. It is still too slow to be useable on my
computer, as I could only get partial results in 6+ hours for
polyhedrons with more than 15 faces.</p><p>I could not rewrite the
tesselation stiching part to keep in memory the faces it manipulates
(the program ignores the faces and uses sides only).</p><p></p>
<p>Once we have possible tilings (which I produced manually), I run them trough my
visualisation script to verify that they are legitimate tile patterns
and if it fills the space.<br>
The visualisation simply starts from one edge (one segment), and draws
clockwise the next shape.<br>
Only one of the manipulated polyhedrons contains a different shape than
a triangle or a square (Hexagonal antiprism contains an hexagon).</p>
<p><img src="filling_space.png" alt="Filling the space with rectangle tiles"></p>
<p>To verify if the shape can be "rolled" into, we need to run
trough:<br>
Each net face to polyhedron face configuration in each orientation
possible, symmetries included.<br>
A branch ends if <br>
-The face to polyhedron with the given orientation was already visited<br>
-The polyhedron cannot roll into the given direction<br>
We keep in memory where the re-visit happenned and visualise it to
check if the polyhedron can fill the space, or if it only fills a band
of space.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="file:///rolltiles.zip"><img src="images/tile_images/capture_009_21042017_193305.png" alt=""></a></div><p>When
we reach a place in the same orientation as the original orientaiton,
